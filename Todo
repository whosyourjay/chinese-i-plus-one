- Best split among segmenters
- Better frequency list. Why are we missing common characters like 一, 三, 多?
- Use word dataset to get definition, pinyin, and audio for the i+1 word
  - generate if missing
- import list and venvs to enable more segmenters
- Reduce the n^2 dependence on i+1 bucket. Maybe already done?

- Cleanup test_segmenters
  - greedy_segmenter to match other formats
  - catch errors and warnings better
  - show test sentence output

Not sure these are good

- Add bold tags back at the end?
